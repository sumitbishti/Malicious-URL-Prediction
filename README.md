# Malicious-URL-Prediction

Our goal is to predict Vulnerable Web URLs through the use of Machine Learninig models like Logistic Regression and MultinomialNB algorithms.

We will be building these two models with two different vectorizers i.e Count and TF-IDf.

At the end we will plot and evaluate the performances of the two models with their vectorizers.s  

# Note:
You will be required to download an appropriate dataset(Malicious sites dataset) before using the Malicious URL Predictor Notebook and move it into the same directory as your notebook!
